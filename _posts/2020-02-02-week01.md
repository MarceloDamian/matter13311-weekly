I decided to take this Open Source software development course because I would like to learn more skills to help improve my communication skills and navigation of sites like GitHub. I know that GitHub is a popular platform for allowing multiple people to contribute to a project. However, I do find GitHub interface a bit confusing. When opening the source code of a project, I see so many different files, all with seemingly vague names. And I don't have a clear understanding of how to navigate the files, and how each file came to be how it is. 
Some questions I have include: 
1. How many people did it take to edit this file to get it to the way it is now? 
2. How many people worked on it?
3. How long did it take for this project to get to its current state. 

Additionally, I would like learn what is the preferred method of communicating between project contributors.
Do they create a group chat? Text-message, or do they just work, and submit contributions and commits and hope that other members of the project will understand what has happened.
