There are many ways to contribute to open source projects. Some ways that I would like to contribute in includes: 
1. Suggesting new features and options
2. Correcting spelling and grammar mistakes in documentations
3. Helping others learn how to use the program

Working on Open Source does not only give me the satisfaction of making a contribution. Participating in a project in Open Source can also benefit my skills. Since I may be working with code, having to learn the code will increase my coding, and debugging experience. 
Open Source can also benefit my communication and collaboration skills. I will need to work on my communication skills so that other participants of the project know what points I am trying to get across. I can understand how frustrating it can be when working with a partner for a project and the partner takes days to respond, or when they do respond, are vague and unclear. 
FOSS can also benefit my career because my contributions can be public. Companies and businesses can see my contributions. Additionally, since the project is Open Source, the code that I contributed into the project, can be used on my Resume. 
Improving my communication skills, and having to communicate with other people across the world can also benefit my personal network. It is possible that I make a friend through a project, and that friend in the future may refer me to a job.
