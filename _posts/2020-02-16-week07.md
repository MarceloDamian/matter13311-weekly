[Comments on open source isn't about you](https://gist.github.com/richhickey/1563cddea1002958f96e7ba9519972d9)
This article or reading really reminded me what open source is open and the pros and cons that come with it. I totally 100% agree with what is said in that article. It is true that open source, you are not entitled anything, and no one is your boss, and you're no ones boss. Being the owner of a open source project does not allow you to boss people around. If you have someone who you have been relying on to make great progress to your project, and suddenly they stopped working because "they don't feel like it", you absolutely cannot say anything to them, and ask them to work. One does not gain any status in life because they helped contribute greatly to a open source project.
