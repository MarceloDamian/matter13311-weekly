There are many different ways to contribute to a FOSS project. Additionally, there are many people who can contribute to a FOSS project.
On top of that, many people have a variety of skills that they are better at or comes naturally to them.
I think the skills that I have that would be most useful for contributing to a FOSS project are also the skills I find most interesting.
For me, I really like testing and trying out new software or applications. It gives me a sense of adventure. Additionally, I have a strong attention to detail, so I can spot little errors or bugs that other people may not notice. This way, I can contribute by submitting bugs. I also like to brainstorm, so I can also suggest new features and options to be added to a FOSS project.
I also really like to teach people something that I am passionate about, so I can help others learn to use the program by giving tips or advice.

This week, I have made contribution to open source by contributing to Open Street Map. I have made a correction / suggestion for the street I reside at. Currrently, on Open Street Map, it shows that there is only one house where my current house is. However, the old house has actually been destroyed, and replaced with two separate houses.
