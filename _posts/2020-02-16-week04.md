Some projects I have looked at include: 
* Bootstrap - https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap
* Microsoft visual studio code - https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode
* Inkscape - https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape
* Jupyter notebook - https://github.com/jupyter/notebook
* Godot - https://github.com/godotengine/godot

Projects I eliminated: 
* Jupyter - the reason I eliminated this is because it isn't in the realm of anything i'm familiar with. I have not ever used Jupyter, and I am still not entirely 100% sure what their program is used for. 
* Godot - I never used this game engine, and also seeing that they have more than a million lines of code makes it a bit intimidating and not a good place to start

Candidates: 
* Bootstrap
* Microsoft visual studio code
* Inkscape

Promising: 
* Bootstrap
* Inkscape
The reason I decided Bootstrap and Inkscape are promising is because I have used these programs before so I am familiar with how to use it. The reason I did not add visual studio code is because I can see that the project is not really active. The most recent changes are a few days old. And in my opinion, I don't think VS code needs anymore improvement. Bootstrap and Inkscape on the other hand looks more active.
